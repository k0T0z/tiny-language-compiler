# tiny-language-compiler

This is a Qt project that demonstrates the integration of Python with the Qt framework.

## Objective

To create a Qt GUI application that demonstrate how to scan and parse tiny language source files using recursive decent parsing method and then generate parse tree for the syntax.

## Prerequisites

Before building and running this project, you will need to have the following installed on your system:

- Qt 7.0.0
- Python 3.11
- PyQt6 (the Python bindings for Qt)
- PySide6
- Qt Creator (optional but recommended for development)

## Features

- Scan tiny language source files for different types of tokens here's a list:

| Token Type    | Value         |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| SEMICOLON     |      ;        |
| IF            |      if       |
| THEN          |     then      |
| END           | end           |
| REPEAT        | repeat        |
| UNTIL         | until         |
| IDENTIFIER    | x, abc, xyz   |
| ASSIGN        | :=            |
| READ          | read          |
| WRITE         | write         |
| LESSTHAN      | <             |
| EQUAL         | =             |
| PLUS          | +             |
| MINUS         | -             |
| MULT          | *             |
| DIV           | /             |
| OPENBRACKET   | (             |
| CLOSEDBRACKET | (             |
| NUMBER        | 12, 289       |

- Parse different kinds of tokens and create the parse tree here's an example for a tiny language source file with it's pasre/syntax tree:
```
{sample program in TINY language- computes factorial}
read x; { input an integer }
if 0<x then { donâ€™t compute if x<=0 }
  fact:=1;
  repeat
    fact := fact*x;
    x := x-1
  until x=0;
  write fact{output factorial of x}
end
```

## Building the project

Here are the steps to build and run the project (for windows we didn't run the project on any other platform):

```
Last modification date: 2023 - 02 - 22 03:35 PM
```
1. Download qt creator or vscode or any IDE you see fit
2. Install python
```bash
https://www.python.org/downloads/
```
3. Add scripts directory to your path (if it doesn't) (this includes pip clang-format etc...)
```
Example path: C:\Users\${YOUR_USERNAME}\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\Scripts
```
4. Install PySide6
```bash
pip install pyside6
```
5. Change python interpreter to point to the right one (qt creator, vscode, ...)
```
Example: C:\Users\${YOUR_USERNAME}\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\python.exe
```
6. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/saifkandil/tiny-language-compiler.git
```
7. Change into the project directory
```bash
cd tiny-language-compiler
```
8. Run the project
```bash
py tiny-language-compiler
```
9. We will not be using CMake since QMake comes bundled with the creator
