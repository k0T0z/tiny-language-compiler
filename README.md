## Objective

To create a Qt GUI application that demonstrate how to scan and parse tiny language source files using recursive decent parsing method and then generate parse tree for the syntax.

```
{sample program in TINY language- computes factorial}
read x; { input an integer }
if 0<x then { donâ€™t compute if x<=0 }
  fact:=1;
  repeat
    fact := fact*x;
    x := x-1
  until x=0;
  write fact{output factorial of x}
end
```

## Requirements
 
 * PyQt6
 * PySide6
 
### Compiler

I'm using MinGW Compiler, either install it from SourceForge or MSYS

### Qt6

* Start by installing the Qt6 SDK from (qt.io)[https://www.qt.io/download]. I decided to go with the Open Source version
* Currently, since this is an experiment, I decided to install Qt 7.0.0. 
* Qt Creator is a sort of an IDE with internal build tools. So currently, it's a good idea to install this.
* We will not be using CMake since QMake comes bundled with the creator
